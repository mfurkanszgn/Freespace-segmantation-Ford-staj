# Freespace-segmantation-Ford-staj
Freesapce segmantation with pytorch 
The aim of this project is to provide scene understanding by labeling each pixel of an image as being road or not road . This will enable a self-driving car to determine the free navigable space on the road. It requires knowledge of FCNs (Fully Convolutional Networks) to create a semantic segmentation model that classifies each pixel.
